## Why this website in this form

Several approaches has been made in the past to create an online Gothic modding documentation. 

One of them is the [Gothic Editing Wiki](https://wiki.worldofgothic.de/doku.php) at World of Gothic. It lacks various areas of modding, that it doesn't address and doesn't offer tutorials about. It is written in German, thereby making it hard to follow for the international modding community. It also contains very outdated information and, as it seems, is not updated anymore. 

A newer approach is the [GMC (Gothic Modding Community) website](https://gothic-modding-community.github.io/gmc/). It aims to address some areas, like modeling and animation, that other resources do not inform about. It is written in English, which makes it more accessible to a larger number of people. It also is open source and hosted on GitHub, like all of our websites are too. New documents can be written in Markdown, as we did it with our Phoenix Docs, which makes it easy to contribute. In these areas it is great. But it is based on a bloated framework, its design is very boring and optimised for mobile with bad readability on Desktop (too wide) and the author was not fond of any suggestion for improvement from my side. Thus I had to do it on my own.

There were more approaches than these. I remember a specific Gothic Editing website, which I guess is offline now, but if anyone remembers the address we may be able to link it here through the Internet Archive. 

But what all of these approaches have in common is something that I just have no understanding for: They all start from scratch, simply ignoring the official documentation by the Mad Scientists. Which is well written and very valuable. So why? 

The entire Gothic Modding Community exists primarily thanks to them and Nico Bendlin. The Mad Scientists have written the engine. They have written the script language Daedalus. They have written the Spacer and they have finally written most of the documentation and brought us the ModKit. But instead of respecting their work and taking their documentation as the foundation for further research and additional tutorials, their work is ignored. 

The only reasoning I can come up with for why that is, may be the focus of a majority of todays modding community on the (so-called) "Gothic 2" and its Modkit, which does not contain said documentation. They may ignore it because they simply don't care for the actual, original Gothic. 

So what I wanted to do instead with this website, is...
* ... to give justice to the original documentation of the Mad Scientists by taking it as the foundation upon which we can build our own, developing their documentation further, not replacing it.
* ... to give justice also to their simple html documentation design, in that I preserve the original design, only transferring it into a kind of dark-mode styling in accordance with Gothic, our Archive and our other websites.
* ...
