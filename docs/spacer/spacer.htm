<H1>What can the Spacer do?</H1>
</a>

It is easier to describe, what the Spacer cannot do. Therefore I will start with this:
<br><br>
The Space cannot:
<ul>
<li>Create a 3D World<br>
    For this a program for the creation of 3D meshes is necessary, such as 3D-Studio Max [today, Blender is the recommended 3D modeling program of choice for Gothic Modding -Flosha]. 
<li>Enliven the world with humans and monsters (NPCs)<br>
    This is completely handled by the scripts. The Spacer can only <em>prepare</em> the world for living beings, for instance by placing a waynet.
<li>Design the Story<br>
    This too is completely handled by the scripts, and here too the Spacer can only prepare: Include Events into the world, distribute objects etc...
</ul>
Thus, one thing is clear: The Spacer is only one tool of many, that was available used in the development of Gothic. To look at it in a very simplified way, the development of a game like Gothic can be imagined as follows:

<ol>
<li><b>Creating the 3D worlds and objects, creatures etc. with a 3D programme and
    respecting numerous requirements while doing so</b><br>
    Such requirements are, for example
    <ul>
    <li>Which height (N)PCs can climb?
    <li>Which Slopes (N)PCs can still walk upon?
    <li>Which "clefts" (N)PCs can jump over?
    <li>How big is a polygon maximally allowed to be?
    <li>Where lies the justifiable upper limit for the amount of polygons?
    <li>and many others ...
    </ul>
    Aside from levels all  kinds of other 3D objects are also created with the 3D programme:
    <ul>
    <li>Trees and bushes
    <li>Fences, Stones, fireplaces
    <li>Items and MOBs (winches etc.)
    <li>many more ...
    </ul>
<li><b>Creating additional necessary data</b><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Textures
    <li>Item-Instances (are generated in the Scripts)
    </ul>
<li><b>Loading the modeled 3D world as a 3DS-file into the Spacer and enliven it with the other created objects and textures.</b><br>
    Here an excerpt from these tasks:
    <ul>
    <li>Texturing the world: e.g. laying textures unto polygons and aligning them ["Mapping"].
        To do this one can make use of a texture-pool. 
    <li>Inserting trees, fences, bushes, torches and more into the world
    <li>Inserting items (potions, weapons etc.) and chests with items according to the intended story
    <li>Creating the Waynet for the NPC-AI. NPCs can move freely, but they need such a Waynet in order to also find locations without problems that are further (>10m?!) away.
    <li>Placing Sounds (Sounds and Daytime-Sounds)
    <li>Illuminate the world, e.g. placing light objects
    <li>Creating Events for the Story. That are for example the infamous winches, switches, traps, riddles and much more
    <li>and several other things: Tracking shots [Kamerafahrten], ...
    </ul>
<li><b>Writing down the Story in the scripts and linking it with the world</b><br>
    This is an essential part, the one that, from a relatively static world, creates a living Something... a Game: 
    <ul>
    <li>Generating NPC-Instances (Humans and Monsters). These are supplied with body meshes, animations etc. 
    <li>Giving fitting routines to the NPCs. For example sending them at day to a working place and in the evening back to bed. 
    <li>Programming the reactions of the NPCs to the player: This is one one hand the general NPC-AI, on the other hand special reactions (I just say "Mud")
    <li>Scripting Dialogues with the player and embedding them into Quests (Missions).
    <li>Inserting the NPCs via a central Script into the level.
    </ul>
</ol>
You see: The Spacer handles equipping the World with everything that is not alive (except the plants maybe). This way, out of a disdainful, boring 3D-Mesh, evolves a quite cozy or not so cozy world, in which one essential aspect is still lacking though: The liveliness of humans and monsters.

Do well and thanks for the fish.
