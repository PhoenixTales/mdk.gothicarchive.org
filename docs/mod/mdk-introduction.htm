	<H1>Welcome!</H1>
	</a>
	
	<p>Now, finally, here is the long-awaited MOD-KIT for GOTHIC!</p>

	<p>Originally we didn't plan to publish such a MOD-Kit. We have decided to do it anyway because the GOTHIC fan community was insistently demanding it. And we have invested a lot of time to make or rather update tools and documentation. However, the creation of Gothic mods is not for amateurs.<br> 
	Programming skills are very helpful, as the creation of mods is heavily script-based. It also can't hurt if you have created mods for other games before.

	<p>The MOD-Kit is a free bonus for everyone who has purchased GOTHIC. 
	<span class="primenote"><b>Please do not contact the Piranha Bytes Support with questions about it. There will be no official support for the MOD-Kit by Piranha Bytes!</b></span>
	Questions to the MOD-Kit can be asked in the forums specifically created for it in the GOTHIC fanpages.</p>

	<p><a href="https://gothic.gOmp.net">http://gothic.gOmp.net</a> [down]<br>
	<a href="https://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/forums/104-Editing">http://www.worldofgothic.de</a></p>

	<p>Of course the GOTHIC team will also drop by there every now and then and try to help you with problems.</p> 	
	
	<p>The MOD-Kit was realised through the interest and with the support of dedicated GOTHIC fans. Thanks a lot to all who already began to develop their own tools. And special thanks to Nico Bendlin, which tool (VDFS Viewer, Extractor and MOD-Builder) was added to the MOD DEVELOPMENT KIT.<br>
	When there'll be people who work just as committed on mods, we can't wait for the results!</p>
	
	<p>Piranha Bytes is already working at full throttle on new projects again. More on that later. What you do with the MOD-Kit lies in your hand now.</p>

	<p>
	We have split the MOD-KIT in a PLAYER-KIT and a DEVELOPMENT-KIT [Devkit &ne; Playerkit]. These were released in two seperate zip files.<br>
	When you just want to play Gothic mods, not creating your own, then you only need the Playerkit.
	The documentation in HTML format, which you are reading right now, is part of the Devkit. ;-)
	</p>
	<p>
	<!-- Find these two documents and link them here!!! -->
	If you want to make GOTHIC MODs yourself, you need both.
	Please read the files <b>Readme_GOTHIC_MOD_Development_Kit.txt</b> and <b>Readme_GOTHIC_MOD_Player_Kit.txt</b> before you start!

	<strong>About the Updates v1.1 to v1.4</strong>
	</a>

	<p>A lot of time has passed since the release of the MDK in 2001. The new projects Alex mentioned above were <em>Unplugged</em> by Mike Hoge and the <em><a href="https://gothicarchive.org/artworks/sequel.html" target="_blank">Gothic Sequel</a></em> by Alex Brüggemann (himself) and Stefan Nyul. Both projects were cancelled. Alex died and the old PB died too with no one of the four founders being a part of it anymore. But GOTHIC didn't die.</p>

	<p>Nor did the Gothic modding community, developing mods, tools and documentation ever since. But the MDK was very outdated. Thus, in 2020 I decided to update it, starting by adding the official updates by Bert Speckels (Spacer 1.5 and associated documentation), that were never included in a full release, in what I called v1.1.</p>
	
	<p>In v1.2 I added all kinds of modding tools developed by the Community in the 20 years prior. With v1.3 we as <a href="https://phoenixtales.de" target="_blank">PhoenixTales</a> started hosting and curating it <a href="https://github.com/PhoenixTales/gothic-devkit" target="_blank">on GitHub</a> and Avallach added all kinds of decompiled assets that we were legally able to include, to simplify modifications.</p>

	<p>With v1.4 we added new tools developed by the community between 2020 and 2022.</p> 
	
	<p>The next step, v1.5 introduces a comprehensive MDK documentation, that becomes part of our GothicMDK. For this we'll translate the entire official documentation by the Mad Scientists from German to English, add a bunch of new community research and build this associated website. You can then download the MDK as a whole or just get individual tools or resources as needed. All the documentation will be implemented in the style of the original documents by the Mad Scientists (just reimagined in a "dark mode"), to preserve and honour their work (more about this in [About the MDK](/docs/about)). Modding tools and tutorials are thus all at one place. And as an important note: <span class="secnote">From now on the MDK will be a rolling release.</span></p>

	<p>Regarding modding support: Other than in the <a href="https://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/forums/104-Editing">editing forum</a> at World of Gothic, which is still alive, you can now also get support at the <a href="https://discord.gg/EnzuKyT5wN" target="_blank">GMC Discord server</a>, a friendly international modding community.</p>
	
	<p>Keep modding.</p>
